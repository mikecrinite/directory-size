# D SIZE
## Directory Size tool

A spring boot app for figuring out what's taking up the most space on your computer.

Most operating systems don't actively keep track of folder capacity. I haven't investigated why, but rather than doing a `right click -> properties` or `right click -> Get Info` over and over until you find the culprit, use D SIZE to calculate a big folder's size, and all the sizes of its children, and then navigate through a clean Bootstrap UI to find your big boi folders
